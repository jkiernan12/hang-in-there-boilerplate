## Abstract
This project was an opportunity to practice Javascript fundamentals and familiarize ourselves with the DOM. The ultimate result is a motivational poster generator that you can use to generate your own posters, complete with images, titles, and inspirational quotes! (Disclaimer: poster efficacy may vary based on user input.)

## Technologies
- Javascript / CSS / HTML
- node
- Atom

## Code Architecture
- JS / CSS / HTML

## Install + Setup
- The project is deployed [here](https://jkiernan12.github.io/hang-in-there-boilerplate/)!
- It will generate random posters for you from our library of default images and text, or you can generate your own using the provided form. Go wild with it!
- On the "saved posters" screen, you can double-click on a poster to delete it from the grid.

## Wins
- This project came together pretty smoothly, with only a few hiccups and bugs that we had to chase down.
- It was a great opportunity to practice git and github workflow, submitting and approving pull requests, and collaborating on a codebase!

## Challenges + Improvements
- Because the posters are all generated with HTML elements, there's no way to export them as JPGs or PNGs.
- For a while, every time we hit the "Make My Poster" button, it would refresh the page! We had to figure out how to disable that default behavior.
- We didn't have time to implement any additional functionality (nothing 'spicy').
